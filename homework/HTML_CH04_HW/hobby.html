        <h1>Hobby</h1>
        <p>One of my most favorite hobbies if I had to pick one, it'll be me walking around in an area. Where it's a little hot but extremely windy, and very much cloudy in the skys. Mostly dark and little little clouds, but the clouds showcasing of what they are showcasing, isn't so indicating that it is going to rain. </p>

   <div id="SecondaryHobby">
    <p>My second hobby, is listening to music, genres like Metalcore, Post hardcore, Screamo, and only sometimes Deathcore.</p>
