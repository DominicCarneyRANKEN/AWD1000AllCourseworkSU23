        <h4>Ingredients You're Going To Be Needing</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of white sugar</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>

        <h4>Directions Guide</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Step 2: Melt sugar in a medium saucepan over a medium-low heat until liquefied and golden in color. Carefully pour hot syrup into a deep 9-inch round glass baking dish, turning the dish to evenly coat the bottom; set aside.</li>
            <li>Step 3: Beat eggs in a large bowl. Add condensed milk, evaporated milk, and vanilla; beat until smooth. Pour egg mixture on top of caramel in the baking dish; place in a deep roasting pan. Carefully pour in enough hot water to come 1 inch up the sides of the dish.</li>
            <li>Step 4: Bake in the preheated oven until just set with a slight jiggle in the center, about 1 hour, checking after 55 minutes. Keep in mind the flan will continue to set as it is cools. Remove from the oven and carefully transfer baking dish toa wire rack; cool to room temperature, then cover with plastic wrap to prevent a skin forming. Refrigerate for 3 hours or up to days.</li>
            <li>Step 5: To serve, run a knife around the edges of the dish; carefully invert onto a rimmed serving plate and let caramel sauce flow over flan.</li>
