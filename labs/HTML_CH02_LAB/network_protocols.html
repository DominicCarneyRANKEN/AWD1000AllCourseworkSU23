            <dd>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP) is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to load webpages using hypertext links. HTTP is an application layer protocol designed to transfer information between networked devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack. A typical flow over HTTP involves  a client machine making a request to a server, which then sends a response message.</dd>

            <dd>Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website. HTTPS is encrypted in order to increase security of data transfer. This is particularly important when users transmit sensitive data, such as by logging into a bank account, email service, or health insurance provider.</dd>

            <dd>The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phone book of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) address. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.</dd>
